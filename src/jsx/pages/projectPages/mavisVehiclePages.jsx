                <p>Most customers with limited knowledge of tires will search their vehicle name when looking for replacement tires. Mavis.com does not currently provide any entry points onto the site for these customers.  </p>

                <h6 className="subheading">Conclusion</h6>
                <h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2>

                <p>Design-wise, I learned a great deal about scaling to accommodate dynamic content, as well as striking a balance between designing for usability and SEO. Though we worked with our developers early in the process, other challenges still surfaced when talking over the technical implementation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Vehicle makes varied widely in number of trims and production years. Designs had to account for anywhere between 5-40 items, without looking too sparse or too cluttered.</li>
                    <li>Pages needed to engage users AND hold a large amount of SEO content. I learned how to best prioritize information and <b>organize content hierarchically</b> to achieve both goals.</li>
                    <li>We created templated copy blocks for each level, so developers could insert dynamic keywords and generate content <b>to scale for 1000's of pages.</b></li>
                    <li>My team needed sources for brand new content, resulting in us contracting an outside vendor for vehicle images, in addition to building our own libraries for logos and vehicle composites.</li>
                </ol>
