                <h1>SimplySpeak App For ESL Career Preparation</h1>
                <p> Born from a <b>3 week design jam</b> with the goal to aid refugees, our team drew from our own experiences with first generation immigrant family and how they've struggled with language barriers and employment. </p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-final.jpg"}/>

                <p>Designed to help <b>English as a second language</b> (ESL) users in career preparation, SimpleSpeak carves a niche with its highly applicable lessons and a community-based style of learning. </p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>

                <p>We start our primary research by conducting 6 interviews. Due to time constraints, we expand our interview pool to include immigrants and users at risk of displacement from their countries.  </p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-interviews.jpg"}/>


                We synthesized our findings into empathy maps and key insights.
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-empathy-map.jpg"}/>
                
                <p>During our first brainstorm, we focused on the issue of <b>connection</b>. We explored the idea of a website highlighting immigrant voices, using quilt-weaving as a metaphor for community. </p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-brainstorming.jpg"} alt={"Initial scrapped idea as a solution to the prompt."}/>
                
                <p>However we found this idea to be not very novel or helpful. Direct donation platforms, like GoFundMe, already exist where users could tell their own stories.</p>

                <h6 className='subheading'>Pivoting</h6>
                <h2>Carving a Niche</h2>
                <p>Upon backtracking to talk with our interviewees in more depth, we discover <b>3 reoccurring issues</b>. We use these to define user personas to guide the rest of our design process.</p>

                <p>We recruited 6 testers from usertesting.com who spoke English as a second language. </p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-user-testing-demographics.jpg"}/>

                <p>Testers completed tasks on the prototype, and were then asked Likert scale and qualitative follow-up questions.</p>
                
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-user-testing-rating.jpg"}/>
                
                <p>Testers pointed out some confusing instructions and requested notifications for group chats, both of which we re-incorporated into the final prototype.</p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/ss-changes.jpg"}/>

                <p>Overall, we received positive reactions from all of our testers about the concept and intuitiveness of SimplySpeak. Half of our testers were genuinely excited about the translation and language help features.</p>

                <h6 className='subheading'>Conclusion</h6>
                <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>

                <p>In bouncing ideas off of other UX designers during this design jam, I gained a lot of valuable insights. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>When in doubt, revisit user feedback and sit down with your users again.</li>
                    <li>Narrow down the target user base. Our designs had clearer direction when we focused on solving one specific problem really well, rather than solving multiple problems all at once. </li>
                    <li>We spent a lot of time iterating on our first decided upon design direction. Stay open to pivoting when early design solutions don't feel quite right. </li>
                </ol>
