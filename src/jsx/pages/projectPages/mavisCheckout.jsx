                <h2>Improving Mavis's Checkout</h2>

                <p>Mavis's flow for buying tires online saw significant diffculty in converting users year over year. In partnership with Marketing, my team sought to improve the tire buying experience at key points of dropoff.</p>

                <p>We targeted <b>product results and checkout</b>: surfacing product value, clarifying confusing UI, and fixing multiple deadends for users.</p>
                
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-tire-results.jpg"} />
                <p>After implementing changes, we saw a <b>46.8% increase</b> in total number of tire purchases year-over-year. And a <b>22.1% increase</b> in the overall CVR for tires ( from 5.9% to 7.2% )</p>

                <h6 className="subheading">Problem definition</h6>
                <h2>Fewer Customers Completing Checkout</h2>

                <p>In 2025, we saw a consistent drop in the conversion rate for tire purchases compared to last year. Though more users were starting the tire buying journey, <b>a smaller percentage of users were actually reserving tires.</b>  </p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-august-graph.jpg"} />
                
                <p>Every step past "adding a tire to their cart," saw lower retention rates (% of users continuing to the next step).</p>

                <br/><br/>

                <h3>We had 3 main goals moving forward with this project</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Improve specifically the % of users who added to cart on the <b>product results page</b> and the % of users who continued to checkout from the <b>cart page</b>. </li>
                    <li>Facilitate the new online promotion the marketing department was launching to drive tire sales.</li>
                    <li>Audit the checkout flow from start to end to identify and solution user pain points.</li>
                </ol>

                <h6 className="subheading">Design Rationale</h6>
                <h2>Improving Product Results</h2>

                <p>Upon interviewing users about the product results page, we found many users confused by the filtering system.</p>

                    imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-results-issue-2.jpg"} 
                    imgWidth={"200"}
                    imgPosition={"left"}
                    title={"Quick Filters vs Filters Button"}
                    description={"The interaction between the quick filter tabs and the manually applied filters was not intuitive. Some expected the filters they applied manually to persist when switching between tabs, while others did not."}>
                </ImgText>

                <ImgText
                    imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-results-issue-3.jpg"} 
                    imgWidth={"200"}
                    imgPosition={"right"}
                    title={"No Filter Results"}
                    description={"The quick filter tabs often yielded no or few results, with no indication as to how many results would be shown until users clicked into a tab. This left the negative perception of very low tire inventory."}>
                </ImgText>

                <ImgText
                    imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-filters-clickrate.jpg"} 
                    imgWidth={"300"}
                    imgPosition={"left"}
                    title={"Filters Click Rate"}
                    description={"Due to the numerous issues with the tabs, along with lower tab click rates, we simplify the filters experience into a single button."}>
                </ImgText>

                <p>Heatmaps of the page indicate that 50% of users stopped just past the first row of tire results and that most users' attention focused primarily on the prices and CTAs.</p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-heatmaps.jpg"} />

                <p>This insight led us to prioritize reducing noise on the page and moving important information, like prices, higher above the fold.</p>

                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-tire-results.jpg"} />

                <p>We additionally reduced the height of the product card to allow for more products to show at once, keeping the most valued tire specs indicated by user interviews (warranty, season, speed rating).</p>

                <h2>Showcasing Value</h2>

                <p>Through strikethroughs, we clearly display the new marketing promotion.</p>

                <p>In discovery sessions however, we quickly realized that with multiple combinations of deals and vehicle fitment types, we had to define over <b>12 different card states.</b> </p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-tire-card-variations.jpg"} />

                <p>To further carry the deals through to checkout, we brainstormed various ways to highlight the savings value at the cart stage and continued iteration on option 5.</p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-cart-variations.jpg"} />

                <p>For the final cart design, we added radio buttons to more clearly indicate selectability, showcased free services before fees, and added the date of tire availability.</p>

                <h2>Resolving Existing Painpoints</h2>

                <p>In my October UX audit, I identified several areas of user frustration in the checkout flow and recommended solutions. View the <a href="https://www.figma.com/deck/wLLmKIMFmXz8QwbQyvb56m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full report here</a>.</p>

                <n/>
                <p>Several of these solutions were ticketed and are being developed on a rolling basis. We will continue to monitor the checkout's performance and adjust changes accordingly to improve. </p>

                <h6 className="subheading">The Impact</h6>
                <h2>More Online Reservations</h2>

                <p>The product result and cart changes were released February 18th. Since then, we've seen a <b>significant increase in online reservations</b> which has persisted over 6 months. </p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-rolling-stats.png"} />

                <p>In March, we saw a <b>46.8% increase</b> in reservations and a <b>22.1% increase</b> in CVR, compared to last year. </p>
                <ZoomImg imgSrc={"img/mt-checkout-march-graph.jpg"} />
                <p>After rolling out fixes to remove unselectable time slots and to improve form validations, we continue to see higher and higher user retention through each step. </p>

                <h2>Challenges and Takeaways</h2>

                <p>Through my collaboration with multiple stakeholders across departments in this project, I learned to: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Guide asks from marketing stakeholders in the direction of more user-centric design. </li>
                    <li>Present data surrounding user frustrations in a compelling way, to gain support for design decisions. </li>
                    <li>Determine what information is actually necessary. Simplify crowded designs without removing any existing useful functionality.</li>
                </ol>
